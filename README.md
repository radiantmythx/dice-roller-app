Welcome!

This application was created with Godot 4.4 and is a very simple dice-rolling application that allows the user to roll a 6-sided die using the left mouse. By clicking the die and releasing, they can watch the die launch into the air, spin, hit the ground, and use land with 3D physics. After the die lands, a number is displayed on the screen representing the number rolled on the die.

This project was put together in approximately fifteen minutes as a proof-of-concept for running Godot applications in browser with an extremely simple model and trivial 3D arithmetic accross various devices.
